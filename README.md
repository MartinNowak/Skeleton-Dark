# [Skeleton-Dark](https://menxs.github.io/Skeleton-Dark/)

Skeleton-Dark is an (un)official Dark version of [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) Skeleton Framework. It featues a dark theme switch based on [this stackoverflow implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56300132/how-to-override-css-prefers-color-scheme-setting).

-----

Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <https://menxs.github.io/Skeleton-Dark/> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Dark Skeleton:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/menxs/Skeleton-Dark/releases/download/2.0.5/Skeleton-2.0.5.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/menxs/Skeleton-Dark.git`


### What's in the download?

The download includes Dark Skeleton's CSS, Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Dark-Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── dark-skeleton.css
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS
